Displays Hello World!

Hello, world. I am new to GitHub, and Earth and I wish to learn more about the human race.
And more specifically, I wish to learn about that thing you call coding. It took me 2 days to understand that Javascript isn't a script made out of Java. Progress.
P.S: My tentacles find Earth's cheeseburgers delicious.
